      "\n",
      "1. **An Accord for a Healthier World**: Pfizer announced this initiative aimed at providing access to its innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines for people living in 45 lower-income countries. This program is designed to address health equity gaps and improve health outcomes for up to 1.2 billion people affected by deadly infectious diseases, certain cancers, and inflammatory diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partnership Model Development**: To overcome the challenge of making the innovative portfolio available across 45 developing countries without individual go-to-market strategies, Pfizer sought assistance from BCG. Together, they developed a partnership model that mitigates risks, meets regulatory requirements, and ensures high distribution security. This model allows for the efficient distribution of medicines and vaccines to those who need them the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Private Sector Engagement**: The initiatives recognize the importance of engaging the private sector as a critical source of funding and support for implementation. By leveraging funding from private entities, including local conglomerates and multinationals, these initiatives can unlock returns, protect assets, and support the implementation of health programs in vulnerable regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Adaptation and Resilience Systems**: While not directly related to health measures, the emphasis on comprehensive adaptation and resilience (A&R) systems in response to climate disruption shows a holistic approach to protecting lives and livelihoods. Such systems can indirectly benefit health outcomes by mitigating the impacts of climate change, which can exacerbate health crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Public-Private Partnerships**: The initiatives leverage public-private partnerships to fund and implement adaptation projects that protect both private assets and local communities. This collaborative approach ensures that the efforts to combat diseases in developing countries are supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders, enhancing their effectiveness and reach.\n",
      "\n",

The report outlines the challenges millions of Moroccans faced due to a widening gap in health equity, which became more apparent during the COVID-19 crisis. In response, the Moroccan government announced a comprehensive set of social reforms to be implemented over three years, from 2023 to 2025, aiming to improve health access and strengthen social protection programs.\n",

BCG's contributions included restructuring the reform agenda, focusing on increasing the quality of care, ensuring the financial sustainability of the programs, and considering the interdependencies between informational and regulatory systems. As a result of these efforts, by December 1, 2022, more than 90% of Morocco's population gained access to universal health care, up from 42% in a remarkably short period. This rapid increase is cited as one of the most significant in modern history, enabling millions of vulnerable families to benefit from improved access to health care, including free access to public sector hospitals and primary health care centers, reimbursement for private care and prescription drugs, financial support for important procedures, and access to specialized expensive drugs for illnesses like cancer and HIV.\n"
